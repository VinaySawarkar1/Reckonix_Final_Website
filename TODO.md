# Migration from Prisma to MongoDB - Script Updates

## Overview
The main server code has been migrated to MongoDB, but several scripts in the `scripts/` directory are still using Prisma. This TODO tracks the migration of these scripts to use MongoDB for consistency.

## Tasks

### Scripts to Update
- [ ] `scripts/importMeatestProducts.ts` - Update to use MongoDB instead of Prisma
- [ ] `scripts/updateProductCategories.ts` - Update to use MongoDB instead of Prisma
- [ ] `scripts/importCustomers.ts` - Update to use MongoDB instead of Prisma
- [ ] Check and update any other scripts that use Prisma

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Test updated scripts to ensure they work with MongoDB
- [ ] Verify data consistency between old and new implementations
- [ ] Remove Prisma dependencies from package.json if no longer needed
- [ ] Update any documentation or README files

## Progress
- [x] Analyzed current codebase and identified scripts using Prisma
- [x] Confirmed MongoDB connection setup in server/mongo.ts
- [x] Created this TODO file to track progress
